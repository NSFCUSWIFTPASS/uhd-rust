//! # `uhd`: Bindings to the USRP Hardware Driver library
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Basic functionality for configuring some USRP settings and receiving samples is working.
//!
//! Some things are not yet implemented:
//!
//! * Various configuration options related to transmitting
//! * Some configuration options related to receiving and time synchronization
//! * Sending samples to transmit
//!
